## Black Jack Application Project

### Week 4 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

##### For this project I created a standard deck of cards separate from the Black Jack application. I then created the Black Jack application and I had it use the previous deck I created.

### Steps Of The Application

##### At the beginning of the program, a new deck of cards is created and it is shuffled randomly. It gives the dealer a face down card from the deck and gives the player a card and displays it. From there, the game gives the player the option to either hit or stay. The dealer will always hit until his cards value is more than 16 which the dealer then will always stay. If the player stays and the dealers cards value is less than 17, the dealer will draw cards until either his value goes above 16 or if the dealer goes above 21.

### Lessons Learned

##### For an application such as this that has so many conditions on who wins, loses, or how to have the programs dealer decides what to do, it becomes very complicated when using the "if" statements and I got very lost, specifically with the method that deals the player and the dealer cards. For every bug that popped up, I kept adding if statements to the method to try to fix things and it eventually just broke everything. I finally decided that it was time that I erased everything in that method and built it up again. Still, there is one bug I am still working on to get fixed when the game decides a winner. If the user tries to quit the game, the application will print out the users information and will break. But other than that, the program works!
