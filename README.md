## Black Jack Application Project

### Week 4 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview

##### For this project I created a standard deck of cards separate from the Black Jack application. I then created the Black Jack application and I had it use the previous deck I created.

### Steps Of The Application

##### At the beginning of the program, a new deck of cards is created and it is shuffled randomly. It gives the dealer a face down card from the deck and gives the player a card and displays it. From there, the game gives the player the option to either hit or stay. The dealer will always hit until his cards value is more than 16 which he then will always stay. If the player stays and the dealers cards value is less than 17, the dealer will draw cards until either his value goes above 16, or ii the dealer goes above 21.

### Lessons Learned

#### 1. For an application such as this that has so many conditions on who wins, loses, or how to have the programs player decides what to do it becomes very complicated using the "if" statements and I got very lost. Specifically with the method that deals the player and the dealer cards and for every bug that popped up I kept adding if statements to the method and it eventually just broke everything. I finally decided that it was time that I erased everything in that method and built it up again. Still, there is one bug I am still working on to get fixed and what happens is when the game decides a winner, if the user tries to quit the game, the application will print out the users information and will break. But other than that, the program works!

#### 2. Getting a program to read separate data from a text file is not the easiest process. I had trouble figuring out how to not only pull data from a text file, but to also get my program to be able to read that data and separate the strings, integers, longs, and doubles from one another.
